Headliner

Link to live site: https://mayabowman.github.io/news-app/

Headliner displays New York Times headlines from 50 years ago today, and lets the user search for any date. If the input is
outside of the range of NYT archives, the user receives a message stating so, and is invited to search for another date. If 
the input format is invalid, the user receives an alert. 

This app uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.
